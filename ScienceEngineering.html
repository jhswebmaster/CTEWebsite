  <h2>Materials Science Technology 1</h2>
  <p>2 Semesters/1.0 Credit</p>
  <p>Grades 9  10  11  12</p>
  <p>CADR, CTE Dual Credit</p>
  <p>Taught by: Greg Shelton</p><br>
  <p> Course Description: Over the course of this class, students will apply new skills and knowl-
	edge to working with various materials such as metals, ceramics, 
	polymers (plastics), and composites. This course also offers college 
	credits (CTE Dual Credit) from Edmonds Community College so long 
	as the student maintains a grade of B or higher. Students will gain an 
	understanding of materials through careful observations, creating, 
	questioning, and building. This engineering course involves welding, casting metals into molds, working glass, cutting polymers, and 
	much more. All in all this class is great for students who love hands 
	on classes and lab science. In the Pacific Northwest, college and 
	university level study in Materials Science Technology is offered in degree programs at UW, EDCC, WSU, U of Oregon, and U of Idaho. This 
	course also offers college credits as long as the student maintains a 
	grade of B or higher. </p><br><br>

  <h2>Materials Science Technology 2</h2>
  <p>2 Semester/1.0 Credit</p>
  <p>Grades  11  12</p>
  <p>CTE Dual Credit (5 College Credits)</p>
  <p>Course Fees: $56</p>
  <p>Taught by: Greg Shelton</p><br>
  <p> Course Description: This course is a continuation of MST I. Students will have more independence in lab selection and design within the current unit of study. 
    Learning will occur through questioning, observing, creating, and building. 
	Students will explore concepts related to the crystal structure of metals, 
	the effect of non neutral flames on metal, controlling the thermal expansion of glasses, glass fusing and will work with various polymers and 
	composites. This course is designed for students interested in deepening knowledge of materials and their applications. Students will be 
	expected to schedule time before or after school for additional work.  </p><br><br>

  <h2>Mechanical Engineering 1</h2>
  <p>2 Semester/1.0 Credit</p>
  <p>Grades  9  10  11  12</p>
  <p>CTE Dual Credit</p>
  <p>Course Fees: $10</p>
  <p>Taught by: Greg Shelton</p><br>
  <p> Course Description: This basic engineering and CAD class is for future engineers, designers and students who like designing and drawing. It is a problem-solving class in which individuals and small groups will use techniques 
	such as brainstorming, model-building, and mock-ups to design 
	solutions to problems and then present those ideas. Approximately 
	50% of the time will be spent using CAD systems such as AutoCAD, 
	Rhinoceros, sketchup, and other software that will introduce students 
	to the world of graphical engineering. CAD/CAM, laser cutters, and 3d 
	printers will be used to take drawings and ideas and transfer them to 
	3-D parts, models, and objects. Students will create a portfolio that 
	will contain their work, organized and presented according to professional standards. Most assigned work can be completed in class, but 
	students can expect up to Â½ hour of homework per week in order to 
	assemble their portfolio. </p><br><br>

  <h2>Mechanical Engineering 2/3</h2>
  <p>2 Semesters/1.0 Credit</p>
  <p>Grades  11  12</p>
  <p>CTE Dual Credit</p>
  <p>Prerequisite: Mechanical Engineering 1</p>
  <p>Course Fees: $10</p>
  <p>Taught by: Greg Shelton</p><br>
  <p> Course Description: This course is designed as a follow-up course to Introduction to 
	Mechanical Engineering. AutoCAD,  3d rendering software, Rhino, 
	and Master CAM software packages are used in the course. Students 
	will design, create, and present their projects to their peers. Students 
	will create a portfolio that will contain their work, organized and 
	presented according to professional standards. Most assigned work 
	can be completed in class, but students can expect up to Â½ hour of 
	homework per week in order to assemble their portfolio. </p><br><br>

  <h2>Computer Science and Electrical Engineering</h2>
  <p>2 Semesters/1.0 Credit</p>
  <p>Grades  11  12</p>
  <p>Prerequisite: Algebra 1</p>
  <p>Course Fees: $50</p>
  <p>Taught by: Greg Shelton</p><br>
  <p> Course Description: This course will provide students with hand on practical knowledge 
	of electronic devices work,. Students learn to design and build devices that detect their surroundings, move, make noise, play music, 
	communicate and respond to remote control. In the process, these 
	students become programmers with the c language. Among the technologies learned are basic laws of electronics including ohmâs law, 
	analog and digital data input and output, pulse-width modulation. 
	Among the skills learned are programming microcomputers in the c 
	language, parts identification, reading electronic schematics, circuit 
	breadboarding, circuit board fabrication, drilling parts insertion, and 
	soldering.  Among the major projects in the first semester are musical 
	instrument that changes pitch and volume as the hands are moved 
	toward and away from the sensors, a robot that detects and avoids 
	obstacles, a rolling robot that is controlled by an infrared remote. The 
	second semester major projects are a working laser tag system, a 
	student chosen and designed project. Past projects have included a 
	pinball machine, a helicopter, a walking robot dog that can balance 
	on two wheels and a air guitar that actually plays.   </p><br><br>
